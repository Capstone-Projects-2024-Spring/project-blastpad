Built around a small but mighty Raspberry Pi single-board computer, the device will be an all-in-one solution for learning to make games and playing them.

Akin to existing handheld gaming devices like the Nintendo Switch, users will scroll through a list of games and choose to either play each game or edit them. Choosing to edit a game will launch the block-based code editor, where users can edit their games.

![System Block Diagram For Blast Pad](https://i.imgur.com/wCdkUu3.png)

This diagram depicts the high-level design of the application from a user's BlastPad device or their laptop/pc. They will be able to open their BlastPad device, use the GUI created with TKinter to access the Blockly Editor. From there they can create programs/games using the editor and publish or download their creations.

The user will access a website that stores their creations, which they can share with their friends. The website will make a call to the backend server, which will query the SQL database for their creations.

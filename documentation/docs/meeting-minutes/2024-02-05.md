## Documentation Feedback

Feedback from the professor on documentation deliverable:

### Functional Requirements
- Should be in order of priority to project
- BlastPad’s main requirement “providing students a learning tool for programming games” should be at the top
### Non-Functional Requirements
- Confusion on if the “BlastPad will be easily navigable for children” should be a functional requirement? Follow up with Applebaum
- These should be measurable, “X loads in Y seconds”
### Use Cases
- Profesor said they like what we have so far
- Order use cases by steps from event storming timeline
### Block Diagram
- Perhaps revise Web Server but for future design phase
- Contention over Tkinter GUI for community hub vs HTML/Css/Js website
